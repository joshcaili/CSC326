Stack for missed calls:

The most recent missed call should be handled first, because itâ€™s
the most likely to be answered. If a customer recently called very
recently. It's unlikely they have put their phone down.

Whereas a call made a while ago, the customer most likely either
does not need support anymore or has moved on to doing another
activity.



Queue for waiting customers:
Customers who have been waiting the longest should be served first. Which preserves the focus for businesses,  "First come first serve".
